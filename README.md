# Brief Intro

This space is dedicated to my journey in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Engineering, where I explore, experiment, and document my progress. Though I haven't updated it in a while, I'm excited to dive back in soon and continue growing my knowledge!

This is my repository to keep track of my learning journing . 
For this i will try to practice something everyday , and upload the file here everyday , so that i can access anytime .


## What's Inside?
Explorations in Software Development: Backend development, system design, and best practices.
Data Engineering & Databases: SQL, NoSQL, and scalable data architectures.
Machine Learning & AI: Model development, LLMs, and real-world applications.
## Plans for the Future

Revamp old projects and add new ones.
Dive deeper into LLMs, AI, cloud computing, and scalable backend architectures.
Experiment with open-source contributions and benchmarking different models.
Document my findings and share knowledge with the community.
